# Bingo Gen
A (hopefully)less crappy rewrite of [bingosync-gen](https://github.com/Angry-Maid/bingosync-gen) with included support not only just for [bingosync](https://bingosync.com), but also for generating static boards for [lockout.live](https://lockout.live)

Mostly was created as a pet project to see and play around with [gpui](https://gpui.rs) and [gpui-component](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component) as well as to try out approach of writing gui and processing via `frontend <-> bridge <-> backend` architecture from [Pandora Launcher](https://github.com/Moulberry/PandoraLauncher).
